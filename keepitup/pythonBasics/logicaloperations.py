# Python code to demonstrate
# True, False, None, and, or , not

# showing that None is not equal to 0
# prints False as its false.
print (None == 0)

# showing objective of None
# two None value equated to None
# here x and y both are null
# hence true
x = None
y = None
print (x == y)

# showing logical operation
# or (returns True)
print (True or False)

# showing logical operation
# and (returns False)
print (False and True)

# showing logical operation
# not (returns False)
print (not True)
